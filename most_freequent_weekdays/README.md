Input: Year as an int.

Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).

Preconditions: Year is between 1 and 9999. Week starts with Monday. Calendar is Gregorian.

most_frequent_days(2427) == ['Friday']
most_frequent_days(2185) == ['Saturday']
most_frequent_days(2860) == ['Thursday', 'Friday']
